# Triune Cognition Integration Summary

**Reviewed/updated:** 2026-04-25

## Current code-logic summary

- `backend/services/cognition_fabric.py` is the canonical fusion layer for
  AATL, AATR, CCE, ML predictor, and AI-reasoning signals.
- `backend/services/triune_orchestrator.py` injects the fused cognition bundle
  into the world snapshot before Metatron, Michael, and Loki run.
- `backend/triune/metatron.py` uses cognition pressure and autonomy confidence
  when suggesting policy tier and next sectors.
- `backend/triune/michael.py` augments and ranks candidate actions using
  cognition-derived recommendations while preserving source attribution.
- `backend/triune/loki.py` turns cognition uncertainty and strategy signals
  into dissent, alternative hypotheses, and challenge metadata.
- Triune remains event-driven through `backend/services/world_events.py` and
  governance-aware through the outbound gate/executor chain documented in
  `docs/triune_governance_integration_matrix.md`.

## Scope

This document summarizes the cognitive layer now wired into Triune end-to-end:

- **Metatron** (belief + policy-tier suggestion)
- **Michael** (ranked command doctrine + preparation/readiness planning)
- **Loki** (dissent doctrine + uncertainty surfacing)

The integration unifies cognitive signals from:

- **AATL** (Autonomous Agent Threat Layer)
- **AATR** (Autonomous AI Threat Registry)
- **CCE** (Cognition/Correlation Engine session summaries)
- **ML predictor** (`ml_threat_prediction`)
- **AI reasoning engine** (`ai_reasoning`, including local/Ollama-capable stack)

## Architecture

## 1) Cognition Fabric (`backend/services/cognition_fabric.py`)

Triune now builds a normalized `world_snapshot["cognition"]` via `CognitionFabricService`.

The cognition snapshot includes:

- `aatl`: high-threat/autonomous session rollup and strategy hints
- `aatr`: registry summary + behavior matches
- `cce`: machine-likelihood + dominant intent rollup
- `ml`: recent risk signal rollup + optional snapshot inference summary
- `ai_reasoning`: snapshot hypotheses/predictions/actions
- `fused_signal`: converged cognitive state:
  - `cognitive_pressure`
  - `autonomous_confidence`
  - `recommended_policy_tier`
  - `recommended_actions`
  - `predicted_next_sectors`
  - `supporting_signals`

### Safety/robustness behavior

- Best-effort operation if any subsystem is unavailable.
- ML snapshot inference is bounded and side-effect guarded:
  - no recursive world-event emissions while Triune is running.

## 2) Triune Orchestrator wiring (`backend/services/triune_orchestrator.py`)

Flow is now:

1. Build base world snapshot
2. Build cognition snapshot (`world_snapshot["cognition"]`)
3. Metatron assessment consumes full snapshot (including cognition)
4. Michael receives metatron + cognition context for planning
5. Loki receives metatron policy + michael selection for dissent/challenge

This creates a single strategic pipeline rather than disconnected cognition side paths.

---

## 3) Metatron cognition behavior (`backend/triune/metatron.py`)

Metatron now fuses:

- baseline strategic pressure (hotspots, sector risk, active response load)
- cognition pressure (`fused_signal.cognitive_pressure`)
- autonomy confidence (`fused_signal.autonomous_confidence`)

Outputs now include:

- `cognition_state` object (fused signal + subsystem summaries)
- cognition-informed `predicted_next_sectors`
- cognition-informed escalation of `policy_tier_suggestion`

---

## 4) Michael doctrine with cognition (`backend/triune/michael.py`)

Michael now:

- augments candidate actions using cognition recommendations
  - AATL recommended actions/strategies
  - AI reasoning suggested actions
  - ML predicted next moves
- maps cognitive actions into executable candidate forms
- keeps source attribution (`base`, `cognition`, `aatl_strategy`)
- adapts endpoint preparation/readiness changes with autonomy and intent signals

Outputs now include:

- `cognitive_action_alignment` with source mapping and selected-action alignment
- enriched command doctrine while preserving ranked action sets/blast radius/reversibility

---

## 5) Loki dissent doctrine with cognition (`backend/triune/loki.py`)

Loki now enriches dissent with:

- autonomous-actor hypothesis when confidence is high
- AATR behavior-match-derived alternatives
- intent-derived hunts from CCE signals
- strategy-aware deception expansions (deceive/poison pathways)
- explicit uncertainty markers for observability/match gaps
- `cognitive_dissent.dissent_on_selected_action` challenge metadata

This ensures Loki is a true dissent/challenge layer, not only static suggestions.

---

## Event-driven cognition integration

- Triune remains world-event-driven via canonical `emit_world_event`.
- Cognition outputs are consumed centrally in Triune orchestration, so downstream policy and action planning use one coherent cognitive state.

---

## Validation coverage

- Triune orchestrator tests now include cognition bundle assertions:
  - fused cognition signal present
  - Metatron cognition state present
  - Michael cognitive alignment present
  - Loki cognitive dissent present
